In this video, we explore a common SQL mistake — using the OR operator in a JOIN condition.
I’ll walk you through a practical example using two tables, show how this approach affects performance, and then demonstrate a cleaner, faster alternative.

Together, we’ll dive into the Execution Plan to understand why the query with “OR” runs slower and how SQL Server processes these queries internally.
